# 8086_project

This project is based on 8086 programming language. HEATER ALARM

WORKING:
Two thresholds are taken as input through keypad, a temperature sensor reads the temperature and converts into digital form through ADC.
The temperature read will be compared with the two thresholds.
If temp_read >= threshold1 compare it threshold 2
    if the temp_read >=threshold2 then glow RED light and on the high intensity buzzer
    else golw YELLOW light and initiate the buzzer with low intensity
else no buzzer, no light
